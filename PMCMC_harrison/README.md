An implementation of particle markov chain monte carlo, for inference on our simple stochastic NSCs model. 
Based on article by Andrieu 2010 and Sherlock et al 2014.
MATLAB implementation.
Would be much faster in C.
May look in the future at whether can make improvements via a lazy ABC type method to avoid some computations.
